# LichBuster_Concept 
 Initial Concept Prototype (UE4.22.3)
 
## Downloading Instructions
1. Download the repository to Github Desktop
2. Navigate to the repository folder, Right-Click on the .uproject file (LichBuster_Concept.uproject) and select "Generate Visual Studios    project files". If this option isn't available to you, make sure you have a version of Visual Studios installed and have opened atleast    one UE4 project on that computer (if you haven't, simply create a new c++ project)
3. Either Double-Click the .uproject file or Open UE4 Launcher, browse to the repository folder and open the .uproject file
4. Make sure the inputs are set up (Project Settings -> Input -> Mappings). If they're blank, hit import and choose the "BaseInput.ini"      from the root directory.  
5. Work on whatever you need to inside of Unreal.

## Committing to Github (when finished for the day)
1. Make sure that you're in the correct branch on Github Desktop before committing (on the top bar)
2. Type a message of what you changed in the summary section and hit "commit to ______"
3. Once it's committed, push to origin (also on the top bar)

## Pulling the latest version
If someone else has worked on your branch since the last time you did, pull their changes
1. Open Github Desktop
2. Make sure you are on the correct branch (top bar)
3. Hit "Fetch Origin" 
4. If there have been changes made to that branch, the  button will change to "Pull From Origin". Click on it.

## Fixing Mistakes
If for whatever reason, something you change breaks your project (even after committing)
1. Open Github Desktop and make sure you're in the correct branch (top bar)
2. On the left side, toggle from "Changes" to "History"
3. Find the problematic commit (it should be the most recent one in most cases.
4. Right Click and "revert this commit"

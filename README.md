# LichBuster-Concept 
 Initial Concept Prototype (UE4.22.3)
 
## Downloading Instructions
1. Download the repository to Github Desktop
2. Open UE4, browse to the Project folder and open the .uproject file
3. Work on whatever you need to inside of UE4.

## Committing to Github (when finished for the day)
1. Make sure that you're in the correct branch on Github Desktop before committing (on the top bar)
2. Type a message of what you changed in the summary section and hit "commit to ______"
3. Once it's committed, push to origin (also on the top bar)

## Pulling the latest version
If someone else has worked on your branch since the last time you did, pull their changes
1. Open Github Desktop
2. Make sure you are on the correct branch (top bar)
3. If there have been changes made to that branch, the "push to origin" button will change to "pull from origin". Click on it.

## Fixing Mistakes
If for whatever reason, something you change breaks your project (even after committing)
1. Open Github Desktop and make sure you're in the correct branch (top bar)
2. On the left side, toggle from "Changes" to "History"
3. Find the problematic commit (it should be the most recent one in most cases)
4. Right Click and "revert this commit"
